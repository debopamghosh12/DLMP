Certainly\! That's the most important part. I'll explain the Python code we put in the Google Colab file, function by function.

Think of the code as being in five main sections:

### 1\. Setup (The Imports)

```python
!pip install networkx matplotlib
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import copy
```

  * This part is just setup. `!pip install` tells Colab to get the necessary libraries.
  * The `import` statements load those libraries so we can use them (`nx` for graphs, `plt` for plotting).

### 2\. Algorithm 3 (MLPA) Code: "The Foundation"

This is the code that finds communities in a *single, static* graph.

  * `def apply_inflation(distribution, in_op)`:

      * This is the "inflation operator" from the paper. Its job is to **strengthen the strong labels and weaken the weak ones.** It takes all the probability scores (like `{'red': 0.6, 'blue': 0.4}`) and raises them to a power (`in_op`). If you square them, 0.6 becomes 0.36, but 0.4 becomes 0.16. This helps the algorithm make a clearer decision.

  * `def check_stop_criterion(dist_a, dist_b)`:

      * This is a simple helper function. It just **checks if the communities have stopped changing.** It compares the label probabilities from the current iteration to the previous one. If they are the same, it returns `True`, and the main loop knows it's finished.

  * `def post_process_communities(label_distribution, r)`:

      * This is the function that gives you the **final answer.** After the main loop finishes, every node has a list of label probabilities (e.g., `Node 5: {'red': 0.8, 'blue': 0.2}`).
      * This function goes through that list and keeps any label whose probability is *above* the threshold (`r`). This is how **overlaps** are found. If `r = 0.3`, a node with `{'red': 0.5, 'blue': 0.5}` will be in *both* communities.

  * `def run_propagation_loop(G, T_max, in_op, ...)`:

      * This is the **"main game"** I described earlier. It's the core of Algorithm 3. It loops `T_max` times, and in each loop, every node "listens" to its neighbors, collects their labels, and updates its own label probabilities. It uses `apply_inflation` to strengthen its choices and `check_stop_criterion` to see if it can stop early.

  * `def mlpa_algorithm(G_initial, T, r, q, in_op)`:

      * This is the **main function for Algorithm 3.** It does the initial setup (adds self-loops, sorts nodes, gives everyone their first unique "t-shirt" / label) and then calls `run_propagation_loop` to do all the work. Finally, it returns the final state (the graph, the labels, etc.).

-----

### 3\. Algorithm 2 Code: "The Updater"

This code's only job is to handle *changes* to the graph.

  * `def update_network(G, changes, T_iter, ...)`:
      * This is the **core of Algorithm 2.** It loops through the list of `changes`.
      * If a change is `"add"`, it adds the edge to the graph (`G.add_edge(...)`).
      * If a change is `"delete"`, it removes the edge (`G.remove_edge(...)`).
      * **Crucially,** after making the changes, it calls `run_propagation_loop` for a *few* iterations (`T_iter`). This is the "Speaker" function from the paper. It's the "fast way" we discussed: instead of starting from scratch, it just lets the labels re-stabilize around the area that changed.

-----

### 4\. Algorithm 1 Code: "The Manager"

This is the main function that manages the *entire* simulation over time.

  * `def domlpa(graph_snapshots, T, r, q, in_op)`:
      * This is the **"manager"** of the whole process.
      * **Step 1:** It takes the *first* snapshot (`G0`) and calls `mlpa_algorithm` on it. This finds the initial communities at T=0.
      * **Step 2:** It then loops through all the *other* snapshots (T=1, T=2, etc.).
      * **Step 3:** In each loop, it calls `update_network` and passes it the list of changes for that timestamp.
      * It also calls `post_process_communities` and `draw_graph` at each step so we can see the results as they evolve.

-----

### 5\. The Example (The `if __name__ == "__main__":` part)

This is the code at the very bottom. It's not part of the algorithms themselves; it's the **script that runs the experiment.**

  * It sets the parameters (like `r_thresh = 0.3`).
  * It creates the initial graph `G0`.
  * It creates the lists of changes for T=1 and T=2 (`changes_t1`, `changes_t2`).
  * It bundles them all into the `graph_snapshots` list.
  * Finally, it makes the one, all-important call: `domlpa(graph_snapshots, ...)` which **kicks off the entire simulation.**
