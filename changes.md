Summary of Changes: From Hardcoded to Flexible

This document explains the changes we made to the code, how it's different from the first version, and the final fix that made it work.

1. How the Code is Different (Old vs. New)

This is the most important change we made. We went from one "hardcoded" file to a more professional, "flexible" system.

Version 1: The "Hardcoded" Script (e.g., domlpa_colab.py)

How it worked: The graph data (the lists of nodes and edges) was written directly inside the Python script in the if __name__ == "__main__": block.

Pros: Easy to run one time.

Cons: To change the graph, you had to find and edit the Python code, which is risky and messy.

Version 2: The "Flexible" Script (Our final domlpa_flexible.py)

How it works: The Python script contains only the algorithm logic. It is designed to load its data from external .txt files (initial_edges_t0.txt, changes_t1.txt, etc.).

Pros: This is a much better design. To run a new simulation with a different graph, you just edit the .txt files. You never have to touch the main Python code.

Cons: It requires the data files to be formatted exactly right, which led to the error we just fixed.

2. The Final Change We Made (The Fix)

This was the last step that made everything work.

The Problem: Our flexible Python script was built to read data, but our .txt files also had header comments (like T=0: Two separate communities and Format: node1,node2). The script tried to read this text as if it were a pair of numbers, which caused the ValueError.

The Fix (What we just did): We did not change the Python code. We changed the data files. We added a # to the beginning of every line that was a comment or header.

Why it Worked: The Python script was already programmed to skip any line that starts with a #. By adding the #, we told the script, "This is a comment, please ignore this line," which allowed it to skip the text and only read the real data.
